                    I've interned at organizations such as Walmart Global Tech and Quintess AI,
                    where I built AI-powered systems using large language models.

                    My experience spans full-stack development, backend engineering, and
                    applied research â€” from neural network libraries to intelligent gameplay
                    systems. I'm motivated by solving complex problems and creating
                    technologies that connect cutting edge technology with real-world impact.
